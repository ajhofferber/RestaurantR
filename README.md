##Functionality

Users are able to:
- Add, remove, and update parties
- Open a new ticket by selecting an open table, inputing party size and assigning a server to that table.
- Take orders from each individual table's tickets and send them off to the kitchen.
- See a list of the waitstaff, where one can add, edit or delete servers.
- See a food menu and a drink menu
- Chefs in the kitchen and bartenders in the bar are able to see specifically the items they must prepare. When an order has been inputted for over 15 minutes, it changes to orange, if it has been inputted for more than 20, it changes to red.
- Servers are able to print and present itemized receipts, with a total at the bottom, as well as tip suggestions.
- Run the app seamlessly, whether using a PC or a mobile device.
